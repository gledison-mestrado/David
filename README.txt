About the gff and fasta files;

>>>>Gff
gff file "Pb18-GFF-2019+NC-sorteddedup_final.gff" was parsed with the custom
script "deduplicate-GFF-IDs-v2.sh" in order to rename some features like CDS wich contained duplicated IDs.
The original gff was downloaded from ParaDB at http://paracoccidioides.com/paracoccidioides-brasiliensis-pb18-downloads/.
Machado does not support dupplicated features IDs because they are used as primary keys.

>>>>Fasta was downloaded from OSF repository "Transcriptomic profiling identifies novel transcripts, isomorphs and lncRNAs in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis" at https://osf.io/yn4ra/.
